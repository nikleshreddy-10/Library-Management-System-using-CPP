# Library-Management-System-using-CPP


This Library Management System allows users to add new book records and access details of existing books in the library. It enables issuing books to students while keeping track of their borrowing history. A late fee is applied if a student returns a book past the due date. Each student can borrow only one book at a time, and a new book cannot be issued until the previously borrowed one is returned.
